## 🟢 Beginner Track

The **Beginner Track** is great for learners looking to build regression models from tabular environmental time-series data. You’ll analyze how weather features like temperature, humidity, and solar radiation impact power consumption in Tetouan City. You'll use models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, and deploy your final model with Streamlit.

📌 Get started:
➡️ [Beginner Track Scope of Works](./beginner/README.md)
➡️ [Beginner Report Template](./beginner/REPORT.md)
➡️ [Submit your work](./beginner/submissions/)

## 🔴 Advanced Track

The **Advanced Track** is for those ready to explore sequence modeling using LSTM, GRU, or Temporal Convolutional Networks. You’ll design time-aware neural networks, experiment with lag features and sliding windows, and optionally include model explainability tools. Deployment may be done via Docker, Hugging Face Spaces, or APIs.
